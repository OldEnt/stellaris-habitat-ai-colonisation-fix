Colonises habitats AI is unable to.

This mod addresses a long-standing bug of AI being unable to colonise its own habitats. It will check annually for an uncolonised Orbital Habitat, Ring World section or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1878751971]Planetary Habitat[/url] and start colonisation process for the empire if it has resources needed to pay colony ship costs (varies between empire types).

No overwrites.
